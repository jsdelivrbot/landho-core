<div><p>Clear in at Gustavia at the Port Captain's office. Immigration is also dealt with here.</p>
<p><span>When going from the French side of St. Martin to St. Barts, no outgoing clearance is necessary (the St. Martin clearance software doesn't even have an entry for St. Barts as a destination) or possible. Boats must clear in to St. Barts as normal, but this is more a way for them to control boat traffic. </span></p>
<p><span>When leaving St. Barts an outgoing clearance is always necessary, even when departing for St. Martin.</span></p>
