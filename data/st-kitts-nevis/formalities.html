Users previously registered with the old eSeaClear system will find all their details have been carried over to the new system.</span></p>
<p>There is now a customs office at Zante Marina and this the most convenient place to berth the boat and complete formalities. <span>Clearance is yacht-friendly here and cruisers report 2014 that the SailClear system is fully operational at this marina. </span></p>
<p>No special clearance for Nevis is now required.</p>
<p>There are similar arrangements for clearing out from Nevis to St Kitts. Arrangements can also be made to visit anchorages outside the Ports of Entry after clearance for another country has been granted.</p>
