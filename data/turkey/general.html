<p>August - <b>Ramazan</b>- a period of fasting, from the Islamic calendar.<br>
It is followed by a 3 day national holiday called "Şeker Bayram" - on 19th,
20th &amp; 21st August. The first day of Şeker Bayram is known as "Eid al-Fitr", 
(the breaking of the fast), when Muslims gather to offer a prayer of thanks. You 
can also expect to see people celebrating at this time. As "şeker" means sugar, 
this particular holiday is marked by a feast of
sweet things - it's especially nice for children.</br></p>
<p>November - <b>Kurban Bayrami</b>, is when sacrificial animals are slaughtered
