<div><p>Report to the Port Captain on arrival at one of the Ports of Entry. Visiting Customs is only required if you have dutiable goods. At subsequent ports, it is only necessary to report to the port captain until leaving the county, when a visit to Immigration is also required.</p>
<p>Visas are no longer necessary for visiting yachts arriving for short stays. Generally, formalities appear to have been simplified in an effort to attract more cruising boats to visit the archipelago. The ship’s papers will be retained by the Authorities, but passports just have to be stamped and are then returned.</p>
<p>There is a fee for clearing out only, irrespective of the length of your stay. This is payable to the Capitania and is separate to any berthing/anchoring fees.</p>
<p>Permits are no longer necessary to visit Fogo and/or Brava islands. However one cannot officially leave the country from those islands and must return to Praia, Sal or Mindelo to collect the ship’s papers and clear out.</p>
