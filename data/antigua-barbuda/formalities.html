<div><p>For a full explanation of eSeaClear's service and other web clearance services in the Caribbean see report <span><a class="external-link" href="Countries/AntiguaBarbuda/eastern-caribbean-cruising-clearance-procedures-simplified/">Eastern Caribbean Cruising: Clearance Procedures Simplified</a></span></p>
<p><strong>eSeaClear for pre-arrival Customs notification</strong></p>
<p>Antigua &amp; Barbudua is cuurently is the only country using the eSeaClear system for pre-arrival customs notification. This service allows the Captain to submit electronic notification to Antigua Customs Officers which aims to speed up the process of clearing into the country by around 75%. In actual fact, cruisers have reported that as well as entering information electronically, forms are then printed, need to be signed and then processed by each department. A lengthy process still.</p>
<p>The eSeaClear website can be found at <a href="http://www.eseaclear.com/" target="_blank"><strong>www.eseaclear.com</strong></a> - please remember the Captain of the boat will still need to clear into Antigua in person at the Customs, Immigration and Parks Offices before proceeding to the marina or fuel dock. eSeaClear have offices now in <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/AntiguaBarbuda/EnglishHarbour">English Harbour</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There are certain clearance procedures common to all ports for vessels clearing into any port in Antigua (note: it's not possible as of May 2013 to clear into Barbuda):</p>
<p><strong>Inward Clearance:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The Q flag must be flown and all crew must remain on board until clearance is completed.</li>
<li><strong>Only the Captain</strong> may go ashore to clear Customs and Immigration with ship's papers, passports, clearance certificate from last port, as well as airline tickets for crew disembarking in Antigua. A download of the official crew list form is available <a href="http://www.jolly-harbour-marina.com/en/marinas-antigua-caribbean/crewlist.doc"><strong>here</strong></a> . This list must be signed by the captain prior to entry. Have 3 or 4 copies of it.</li>
<li>If a vessel arrives after hours, the captain must ensure that no crew goes ashore until clearance has been completed at the first opportunity.</li>
<li>Crew leaving a boat must have a valid airline ticket to a country that will accept them without question. This ticket must be presented to the Immigration official when being signed off the vessel.</li>
<li>Captains wishing to exchange crew members with another vessel must do so in the presence of an immigration official.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Note: Heavy fines have been levied of late, in both Jolly Harbour and English Harbour ($5,000 EC), against yachts whose crew leave the boat before customs clearance, or against Captains who send crew to complete clearance.</i></p>
<p><strong>Outward Clearance:</strong></p>
<p>Port fees must be paid before collecting the port clearance certificate. This must be presented to the immigration official, together with the ship's papers and passports. Vessels must leave within 24 hours after completing clearance procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Clearance in Barbuda:</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to<strong> clear in</strong> at Barbuda you must first seek permission from the head of Customs,  48 hours in advance. Contact email for <a href="mailto:customs@ab.gov.ag" target="_blank"><strong>customs@ab.gov.ag</strong></a><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> <a href="mailto:queenbee.fdr@gmail.com" target="_blank">queenbee.fdr@gmail.com</a> </strong>and phone or fax to <a href="tel:%281-268-462-2767" target="_blank"><strong>1-268-462-2767</strong></a>. The details required are : the purpose of visit, the crew   list, the details of the vessel- size, class, capacity etc.</p>
<p>If you wish to <strong>clear out </strong>from Barbuda, you can either clear out from Antigua and visit Barbuda on departure (but must leave within 24 hours), probably the more straightforward option, or, ring 460 0085 or 725 7933 and ask to clear out at the office in Codrington (advisable to do this from Antigua to be on the safe side).</p>
<p>The difficulty with this is, of course, is that one needs a phone and coverage in the Spanish Point to Coco Point area is very poor. In addition clearing out in Barbuda can be a time consuming affair as it's a long way to the local offices.  See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/AntiguaBarbuda/Codrington">Codrington</a></strong> for more details.</p>

<div><p>All visitors require a passport valid for at least 6 months beyond their departure date.</p>
<p>No visas are required by nationals of most European countries, USA, many South American, Caribbean, or Commonwealth countries <strong>(except</strong> nationals of Bangladesh, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, India, Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka who <strong>do</strong> require a visa).</p>
<p>For an up to date list of which citizens who do require a visa see <a href="http://cip.gov.ag/how-to-apply/passport-visa-requirements/"><strong>http://cip.gov.ag</strong></a></p>
<p>On arrival, Immigration will issue a visa for the duration of one's stay(maximum of 6 months). It is advisable to request more than the intended time, as extensions must be obtained from the capital of St John's and can cost as much as US$100.</p>
<p>If crew leave the boat in Antigua, they must have a valid airline ticket out of the country; it is the captain's responsibility to provide this ticket for all persons leaving and to ensure that they sign off the ship's crew with immigration. Crew arriving to join a yacht by air must show to Immigration on arrival, a copy of a letter signed by the captain, together with a copy of the ship's papers. Immigration must be notified of any crew departures or changes.</p>
