<ul>
<li>In recent years Nicaragua has been avoided by cruising yachts and for good reason, although with the changing political situation this is no longer the case. The shallow reef-encumbered Miskito coast has many attractive anchorages, but navigation is difficult and even in the past when the area was not off-limits, most yachts restricted their cruising to the more accessible Corn Islands.</li>
<li>The opening of Marina Puesta del Sol, 13 miles north of Corinto, marks an improvement in facilities available.</li>
<li>Nicaragua's decision to extend its territorial waters from the normal 12 miles to 25 miles has resulted in the seizure of some foreign flagged vessels, mainly fishing boats. In their fight against illegal fishing, the Nicaraguan authorities have confiscated boats and arrested their crews, as a result of which the USA have warned all US vessels to avoid Nicaraguan waters, both on the Pacific and Caribbean side. Cruising yachts do not appear to have been affected, but those which intend to stop in Nicaragua should proceed directly to an official port of entry.</li>
<li>Even after the cessation of hostilities, provisioning in many places is still difficult. Even essential goods are difficult to obtain in some places and this includes fuel. There are simple repair facilities in most ports.</li>

<p>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com">safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</a>) gather information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have information about a security incident, as well as contacting Noonsite please also forward details to the Caribbean Safety and Security Net, as theirs is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors on the net. Please be sure to include boat name, date of incident and anchorage/port where the incident took place.</p>
