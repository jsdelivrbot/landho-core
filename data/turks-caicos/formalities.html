            </h2>
<div><p>The Turks and Caicos Government operates a radar surveillance station that monitors vessels entering and departing their territorial waters.  Vessels entering or leaving the twelve mile limit can contact the station by calling “Provo Radio”. The station operates 24/7 on VHF Channels 16 and 64 and also broadcasts navigational warnings and weather forecasts.</p>
<p>The radar and radio transmitters are mounted on a 40 meter tower located in the South Dock area on Providenciales at 21° 44.44′ N/72° 16.26′ W</p>
<p><span>The<span> </span></span><span><a href="http://www.sailclear.com/"><span><strong><span>SailClear</span></strong></span></a></span><span><span> </span></span><span>advance web notification service for clearance is operational. </span><span></span></p>
<p>When within range of the harbour, try to call the Harbour Master on VHF channel 16. They do not however always monitor the radio, particularly if it is a cruise ship day.</p>
<p>Boats waiting to clear-in can either anchor in the designated anchorage zone or moor alongside the dock and await the boarding officer. Whilst the anchorage is crowded, it is preferable to the dock which is concrete and very high with <span>widely-spaced rusty bollards and rubber tyres. Not designed for yachts.</span></p>
<p><span></span>If necessary, the skipper should go ashore to the office to initiate clearance, but no one else must leave the boat until clearance is complete.</p>
<p>Boarding officers will also give information regarding National Parks Regulations and details of the regulations that affect cruising while in national waters.</p>
<p>The Harbour Master will issue a 7-day cruising permit for a reasonable US$50. Vessels wishing to stay longer must obtain a Cruising permit that is valid for 8-90 days and costs considerably more. No more than two 90 day cruising permits will be issued in one calender year. (See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/TurksCaicos?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> below).</p>
<p>Clearance formalities can be completed at the following ports and marinas:</p>
<p><i>Providenciales:</i><br/> South Dock (for Sapodilla Bay anchorage), South Side Marina, Caicos Marina and Shipyard, Turtle Cove Marina, Turks and Caicos YachtClub (Leeward).</p>
<p><i>South Caicos:</i><br/> Government Dock, Seaview Marina</p>
<p><i>Grand Turk:</i><br/> Government Freighter Wharf (south end of the island), Coburn Town Dock (1/4 mile north of radio tower), Flamingo Cove Marina.</p>
<p>Some of the marinas that have difficult entrances can be contacted on channels 16 or 68, either for advice, or they may send out a pilot boat, for which a charge is usually made.</p>

<div><p>The Customs officer clearing your vessel and crew will issue a <span>Pleasure Craft Report of Arrival and Temporary Importation Declaration (Form C108-6/93) declaring the crew and any goods aboard.</span></p>
<p><span>If staying longer than 7 days, a Cruising Permit (Form C113-6/95) granting a "3-month Temporary Importation without payment of Customs charges" for the vessel is also issued. The permit is valid for three months. Note that only two cruising permits may be issued in the same calendar year. Dry-docked periods are exempt. Yachts remaining in the Turks and Caicos Islands longer than 6 months now pay an import tax of 12%.</span></p>
<p><span>Any Guns and ammunition aboard must be handed over to the Customs officer, with a proper receipt received. These are then returned by Customs when the vessel is cleared outwards from TCI. 24 hours' notice must be given to retrieve firearms on departure.</span></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Boats in transit can have parts and equipment shipped duty-free. There are several direct flights every week to the USA and UK, also two air freight flights weekly to Florida. It is advisable to check with Customs first for the arrangements required and to check that no duty is due.</p>
<p>Firearms, including those charged with compressed air, must be declared and brought in to Customs with you when you clear.  Unless you have prior approval in writing from the Commissioner of Police, Customs will impound them and store them for you at the police station until your departure.</p>
<p>Spearguns and Hawaiian slings are also illegal and must be brought in to Customs when you clear.</p>
<p>The importation of controlled drugs and pornography is illegal in the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
