<div class="hello"><div><p>The approaches and entrance to the marina are straightforward and Pasito Blanco Marina (Club de Yates de Pasito Blanco) keeps a 24-hour listening watch on VHF channel 6. On arrival, the skipper should report to the port office during office hours: 0900-1300,1500-1700 Monday to Friday, 0900-1300 Saturday, Tel. 928 142194, Fax 928 142546.</p>
<p>Water and electricity are laid to all berths and are included in the charges. There are hot water showers and toilets on the outer wharf and showers are also available in the boatyard. Long term rates being considerable lower than the daily rate and there is a 30% discount for stays over 6 months. The marina can provide a caretaker service for yachts laid-up afloat.</p>
<p>The marina is fairly isolated, which for some people is its main attraction. The gate into the resort is guarded 24 hours a day, making it a good place to leave a boat unattended for long periods. There are now floating pontoons (with cleats) around most of the quay wall allowing stern lines to rise and fall with the tide (2 metre tidal range).</p>
<p>A new restaurant in the marina "La Punta Yacht Club" opened in May 2011.</p>
<p>Last updated May 2011.</p>
