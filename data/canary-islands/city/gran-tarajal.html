<div class="hello"><div><p>The harbour has good protection from the south and west with two pontoons in the western part.</p>
<p>The new marina here provides berths for yachtsmen and the local fishing fleet as well as a centre for the new sailing school. There is reported to be plenty of space with the pontoons to port being for yachts over 15m. It is also very reasonable for overnight berthing.</p>
<p>Arriving yachts should come alongside the main quay and report to the port office by the main harbour gates (open 0800-1400 Monday-Friday).</p>
