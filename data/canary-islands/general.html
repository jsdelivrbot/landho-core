<div><p>International dialing code for Canary Islands is +34.</p>
<p>Each Spanish network provides coverage of the Canary Islands. This includes the 7 main islands - Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma, Gomera, Hierro - as well as Alegranza, Graciosa, Montaña Clara, Roque del Este, Roque del Oeste und Lobos.</p>
<p>To listen to voicemail just dial 901.</p>
<p>Standard national post is slow, but often poses less of a customs problem if wanting to bring in spare parts. If you are not in too much of a rush, this can be the most economical and reliable option. See the <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/CanaryIslands?rc=Formalities#Customs">Customs</a></strong> section for further details on shipping in spares to the Canaries.</p></div>

<div><p>All major tourist areas, larger towns and ports are well served by buses.
Taxis are plentiful and inexpensive.  Town taxis run on meters but for longer trips it is best to ascertain price. 
Car hire is reasonably priced.
There are many flights both scheduled and charter to the international airports. Flights available to mainland Spain and Interisland flights are frequent but they need to be booked well in advance.
