<li>Vanuatu, formerly called the New Hebrides, is an archipelago of 83 islands in the Western Pacific around 1,750 km east of Australia, lying at the end of a chain of volcanic peaks stretching southeast from Papua New Guinea. Espiritu Santo, Malekula, Efate, Erromango, Ambrym and Tanna are the main islands. With a unique blend of Melanesian (Ni-Vanuatu) tribal communities, pristine beaches, stunning active volcanoes and truly memorable diving, Vanuatu has much to entice visitors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Left alone by the Europeans for longer than other parts of the Pacific, Vanuatu leapt into the modern age quickly, while remaining a place where the rich Melanesian culture is kept very much alive. It is the chance to experience a little of this fascinating culture that brings most sailors to this country which has been endowed with less cruising attractions than its neighbours. </li>
<li>With the exception of the northern islands, the number of natural harbours is rather limited, with the notable exception of the main island Efate which has several attractive bays. </li>
<li>One of the greatest attractions of the islands is a visit to the live volcano on Tanna or Ambrym, where one can ascend into the crater, the closest one can get to an active volcano safely anywhere in the world. Even sailing by these islands one can be treated to a spectacular firework display, especially at night.</li>
<li><strong>Getting work done:</strong> Limited services here. Port Vila has haulout facilities. Marine electricians and mechanics are available and mostly knowledgable. Spare parts can be ordered from Australia.</li>
<li><strong><b>Fuel: </b>One can order duty-free diesel fuel on clearing out both in Luganville and Port Vila.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Provisioning:</strong> The outer islands have an increasing number of stores and shops, stocked with basic items. However nothing will compare with the facilities available in Port Vila or Luganville (the Bon Marche supermarket is good value with a French influence and many Australian &amp; European brands). Many small island resorts are extremely helpful to yachts and one can arrange provisions as well as guides and tours through the local village chief.</li>
<li>Many villages receive little or no contact with the outside world other than through yachts. Trading goods for local carvings and fresh produce is a major source of clothing, school supplies, and currency for these villagers. Carry second-hand clothing, notebooks, pencils and pens, fishing line and hooks, reading glasses, old magazines, etc. for bartering with locals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tropical Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu, hitting the capital of Port Vila on Efate, as an extremely destructive category 5 cyclone on the evening of 13 March, 2015. Winds are estimated to have reached 250kmph with gusts peaking at around 320kmph, causing serious damage to infrastructure and leaving debris strewn across the island chain. It will take the Islands a long time to recover, see news items and reports adjacent as to how the cruising community can help.</li>
