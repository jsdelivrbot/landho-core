<div class="hello"><div><p>For the visiting yacht, there are several berthing options.</p>
<p>Locking through to the Bassin Vauban provides complete shelter, with the added bonus of being right under the walls of the <code>Intra Muros</code> (the old city).</p>
<p>The large marina at Les Bas-Sablons also provides a useful base, although is is a long walk from the old city. It is the best situation if any repairs are required.</p>
<p>The river Rance itself provides a huge number of anchorages, once through the lock in the Barrage. There is also a marina 6 miles up river, at Plouer, as well as ones at Lyvet (by the Chatelier lock) and at Dinan (if you draw 1.5m or less).</p>
<p>In more settled weather, the anchorage off Dinard is attractive, although it is a fair way from the shore. Also in the bay on the eastern side, north of the Sablon Towers. Don't be caught out by the huge tide range here - up to 13 metres!</p>
<p><b>Ile des </b><span><b>Hébihens</b>, just west of St. Malo, is one of </span><span>Brittany's treasures. Yachting Monthly produced a short cruising guide to the island in October 2015 - go to <b><a class="external-link" href="http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/cruising-guides/ile-des-hebihens-brittany-32236">http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/cruising-guides/ile-des-hebihens-brittany-32236</a></b></span></p></div></div>

      Usually very crowded; berth where you can fit in. Wonderful location, but no effective security. Helpful staff. Water &amp; (free) electricity on the pontoons. No repair facilities. The lock into the basin is a commercial one; large and deep, so be prepared with good long lines on both sides and be well fendered. The lock keepers usually lower looped lines to which you attach your own but if they are busy with a commercial craft, you might well be left to fend for yourself. There are two ladders on each side, but nothing else to attach to.
Good facilities, including laundry.

      Berth at pontoon A, the first one, once over the sill. In the approach, be aware that the ro-ro ferry berth is close to port. There is an illuminated board at the entrance, displaying the depth over the sill. A good range of repairs is available as well as hauling out and the usual boatyard services. Arrangements for fuel have to be made with the capitainerie as the automatic payment system only accepts French credit cards. Bar, resaurant, good facilities, launderette, chandlery.

      Generally the lock opens on the hour when the water level is at least 4m above chart datum. Information (in French only) regarding the water levels above the barrage is available from Bassin Vauban and Les Bas-Sablons. Now the turbines are only run occasionally, the level is usually maintained at a mimimum of 4m above chart datum between 7am and 8pm local time, and at 8.5m for at least a 4 hour period during that time. If planning to catch the last locking before low water, call up on the VHF to check, as it does not always open if the water is not at the predicted height.

The tidal streams in the vicinity of the lock can be very strong. There are white waiting buoy on both side of the barrage.
