<div class="hello"><div><p><span>This ancient, medieval town is situated about five miles from the open sea, up the winding river of the same name. The marina is in a locked basin, which is dominated by the high and dramatic viaduct which arches over the town. It is a very sheltered and secure place in which to leave a boat for a while. It has good transport connections.</span></p></div></div>

<div class="hello"><div><p><span>If arriving too early on the tide,(i.e. before half flood) there is a very useful, protected anchorage at Pen Lann at the mouth of the estuary. The river is prone to silting up, so approaching and leaving on a rising tide is advisable. A draft greater than 1.5m might cause problems on other than a spring tide.</span></p>
