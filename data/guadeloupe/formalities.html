<div><p>All visitors (including French citizens) require a passport valid for 6 months.</p>
<p>As an overseas territory of France, and therefore a member of the EU. Guadeloupe comes under French immigration rules, but is <strong>not</strong> a member of the Schengen Area Agreement.</p>
<p>For the exact details applicable to Guadeloupe, see the <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary"><strong>French Embassy website</strong></a></p>
<p>All other nationalities require visas, which should be obtained from a French embassy or consulate in advance. Ensure that the visa given is valid for Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>Visitors from South America and some Caribbean islands may need a certificate of vaccinations against smallpox and yellow fever.</p>

<p>Guadeloupe is a French Department, therefore the health care system is excellent. Unlike most tropical regions, there are almost no communicable diseases or those transmitted by parasites. There are no poisonous or dangerous animals, except as noted below. 
Other good advice: </p>
<p>Don't stay under the Manchineel tree (similar to an apple tree). It has caustic and mildly poisonous sap. Don't touch the leaves or eat the fruits. The juices burn the skin. The main island of the Guadeloupe archipelago is cleared of most of these trees, but there are still plenty of them on the Saintes and on Saint-Bart - very often marked with warning signs. </p>
<p>Some fish, especially around the northern islands eat poisoned seaweed which can lead to severe food poisoning in humans. </p>
<p>Swimming in some rivers is dangerous because of Bilharziosis (a parasitic disease). Normally there are warning signs.</p>
<p>Beware of the Scolopendra (millepede with a shell). Its sting is similar to that of a scorpion. </p>
<p>Be aware of stray dogs at the beaches, because they can transmit worms. Wear your sandals to the beach and use a mat. </p>
<p>Some mosquitos transmit the Dengue virus.  Sleep under a mosquito net.</p>
