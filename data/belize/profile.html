            </h2>
<div><ul>
<li>Belize, formerly known as British Honduras, fronts the Western Caribbean Sea and borders on Mexico and Guatemala. </li>
<li>Belize's main attraction lies offshore, a 175 mile long barrier reef, second only in size to the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, and the underwater scenery is reputed to be amongst the best anywhere in the world.</li>
<li>Between the reef and the coastal strip are hundreds of uninhabited islands and cays, and therein lies Belize's popularity as a cruising destination; the number of secluded anchorages, unsurpassed diving and excellent fishing will ensure Belize's attraction as an alternative to the crowded Eastern Caribbean.</li>
<li>Many of the navigation lights or marks are reported to be either out of action or missing and therefore night passages should be avoided. Even in daylight the barrier reef area should be navigated with caution.</li>
<li>Yachting facilities are limited in Belize: Belize City has some repair facilities, good provisioning, a limited supply of hardware but very little yachting equipment. Frequent theft from boats and lengthy formalities means however that few boats now go to Belize City if this can be avoided. There is a new boatyard in Placencia.</li>
<li>A more convenient and safe place to leave the boat if intending to visit the interior, which is another of the main attractions of Belize, is the new marina, Cucumber Beach Marina, just south of Belize City. It has been reported that the marina is also a good place from which to visit the Mayan sites in Guatemala, such as Tikal.</li>

<div><p>A particularly violent attack on a charter catamaran in 2012 in the Pelican Range of Cayes (see news item <a href="Members/sue/R2012-03-23-5">here</a>) means that cruisers are recommended not to anchor here overnight.</p>
<p>Whilst the Pelican Range of Cayes have seen a few security incidents against yachts in the past, this is the first violent attack against a yacht in Belize that has been reported to Noonsite.</p>
<p><span>You should take precautions against street crime. There have been occasional violent incidents against tourists. The George Street and Kraal Road areas of Belize City are particularly dangerous due to gang violence and gun crime.</span></p>
<p><span>Free Cruising Guides have completed the Caribbean Security Index (CSI) review of 2013 and updated the country ratings. The latest update of the CSI contains new information that may be important to you to “route around crime.”</span><br/><span>See this report at</span><strong><a href="Countries/CostaRica/Countries/Anguilla/General/Piracy/caribbean-crime-caribbean-security-index-csi-review-of-2013">http://www.noonsite.com/General/Piracy/caribbean-crime-caribbean-security-index-csi-review-of-2013</a></strong></p>
<p>The Caribbean Safety and Security Net (<a href="mailto:safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com">safetyandsecuritynet@gmail.com</a>) gather information by anchorage or by island, so sailors can plan their cruising in the Caribbean with an eye to appropriate behaviour and precautions wherever they decide to go. Should you have information about a security incident, as well as contacting Noonsite please also forward details to the Caribbean Safety and Security Net, as theirs is the most comprehensive source of Caribbean security incidents against sailors on the net. Please be sure to include boat name, date of incident and anchorage/port where the incident took place.</p>

<div><p>The tropical climate can be hot especially February to May, although the prevailing wind helps to keep the coast cooler. During winter months the anchorages are rather exposed to the northerly winds which sweep down across the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane season lasts from June to November.</p>
