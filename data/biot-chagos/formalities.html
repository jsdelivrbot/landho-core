<div><p><span><b>Note this FCO advice to yachts planning to visit Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory):</b><b><br/></b>T</span>he British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is not a tourist destination. Applications from transiting yachts are checked carefully  to ensure that a stop there is essential for their safe passage across the Indian Ocean. Where that is not the case, or there is any concern that the visit is not consistent with the policies and laws of the British Indian Ocean Territory (in particular its ambitious environmental objectives) a permit will not be granted.</p>
<p>Yachts wishing to visit BIOT must <strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/biot-visit-permit-request-form-yachts">apply for a permit</a></strong> and Immigration Clearance in advance and the applicable fee is also payable in advance.</p>
<p><span>The maximum stay permitted is 28 days. BIOT Permits are paid for and approved by the week (7 day periods), not by the day. See<strong> <a class="external-link" href="?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> for details. <span>When applying for a permit, it may be wise to purchase a four week period which would give you greater flexibility for arrival and departure dates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>It is recommended to start the permit application process early as it may</span> take several weeks.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>How to apply for a Permit</strong></p>

<p align="LEFT">2. Go on-line to the BIOT website and complete the two page <strong>Declaration For Yachts In BIOT Waters</strong> form at <strong><a class="external-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/declaration-for-yachts-in-biot-waters">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/declaration-for-yachts-in-biot-waters</a></strong>.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><span><span></span></span>Do NOT wire transfer the funds for the permit at this time.</p>

<p align="LEFT">9. After the funds have been transferred, contact your bank for verification of the transaction.

                Restrictions
                
                
            </h2>
<div><p><span>BIOTA is committed to preserving the rich environmental heritage of the British Indian Ocean Territory. Marine protected areas are recognised by scientists and the international community as essential to the conservation and sustainable management of oceans and fisheries. BIOT hosts the world’s largest contiguous ‘no take’ marine reserve, along with several strict nature reserves.</span></p>
<p>If you are granted permission, you must moor your vessel at the <strong>BIOT approved sites</strong> only, to help conserve BIOT’s fragile coral environment. If your vessel is not moored at one of the approved sites, you are liable to be issued with an on-the-spot fine of £500. Failure to pay the fine could result, on conviction, to imprisonment not exceeding 6 months and/or a fine not exceeding £3,000.</p>
<p>Any person entering the Strict Nature Reserves of Great Chagos Bank (The Three Brothers and Resurgent Island; Danger Island; Cow Island; Nelson Island) and Peros Banhos Atoll (all the islands to the east of a line drawn between the easternmost point of land on Moresby Island and the easternmost point of land on Fouquet Island - in practice, this means that one may only anchor off the western islands which is quite unsafe during the SE trade wind season), is liable to an on-the-spot fine of £1000. Failure to pay the fine could result, on conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and/or to a fine not exceeding £5000, and to detention and forfeiture of any boat and equipment used when committing the offence.</p>
<p><span>The Strict Nature Reserves also include the territorial seas around each of the named islands, and therefore transit within 3 nautical miles of the islands is prohibited, as is any water-based activity, e.g. fishing.</span></p>
<p>The islands are a conservation area and all flora and fauna, such as turtles, coconut crabs, live coral and shells, are protected.</p>
<p><span>The heart of a palm should not be taken. </span></p>
<p><span>Possession of spearfishing equipment is strictly prohibited, but a permit may be granted for the possession of scuba diving gear. </span></p>
<p><span>The policy of the BIOT Marine Protected Area is for no fishing. An exception to this is to allow cruisers to fish for their own consumption (no more than three day’s worth) with a hand line only. BIOTA require all visiting yachts to complete a fishing log (a blank log will be sent out with the permit), which should be kept up to date during your visit as a Fisheries Protection Officer may wish to see it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Penalties for infringement of the regulations are severe.</span></span></p>
