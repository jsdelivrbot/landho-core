<div><ul>
<li>With the over throw of the regime of Colonel Gaddafi, the situation in Lybia with regard to cruising boats is not known. </li>
<li>The economy is dominated by oil production although efforts are being made to diversify into other industries, agriculture, and even tourism. The country has some spectacular archaeological remains, such as those in the city of Leptis Magna, which has possibly the best Roman site in the Mediterranean. </li>
<li>Previously, entry formalities could be very difficult and the same rules applied to cruising yachts as to ordinary tourists. Arrangements for visits should still be made well in advance through the appropriate agents who will also arrange any visits ashore. Cruising yachts without these arrangements in place are therefore advised to avoid Libya and to keep well out of its territorial waters when sailing past its shores. </li>
<li>Now that the political situation has changed, it may, in time, be easier for private yachts to call at Libya's ports.</li>
<li>If cruising the waters bordered by southern Sicily, Malta, Tunisia and Libya, be aware that because of an influx of migrants attempting to leave from Northern Africa there is an increase in Navy patrols in this area and the danger of small unlit craft carrying passengers. </li>

<div><p>The situation in Lybia is volatile and current advice should be sought before planning tovisit. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya"><b>FCO Foreign Travel Advice.</b></a></p>
<p>The current U.K. Foreign Office advise is:-<br/> "<span>Since December 2013, a number of foreign nationals have been shot dead in Libya, mostly in Benghazi and Derna. Further attacks against foreigners are likely and could be opportunistic.</span></p>
<p>There is a high threat from terrorism including kidnapping. Since January 2014, a number of foreign nationals have been kidnapped, including in Tripoli.<span>"</span></p>
