<div><ul>
<li>Thailand is visited yearly by a large number of yachts and formalities are  getting simpler every year. September 2011 saw the launch of on-line check in  for yachts in Phuket. However, as with Singapore, in 2014 the requirement to have AIS on board in Phuket was introduced. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand?rc=Formalities">Formalities</a></strong> for more information.</li>
<li>The country's cruising attractions are many: its rich culture inland; secluded  anchorages around Phuket Island and its many offshore islets, away from the  crowded resorts; many anchorages to be found on the coast north from Malaysia.</li>
<li>Both repair and docking facilities have greatly improved in Phuket in recent  years. Facilities in the other ports are more limited. More repair facilities  are obviously available in the capital Bangkok, but it is a busy polluted city,  totally unsuitable for yachts.</li>
<li>If carrying out substantial repairs in Thailand, care should be taken to  oversee all works. Whilst prices are very cheap here, often, unskilled labour  are used by yards with little or no knowledge of yacht systems. Failure to  supervise on your part could result in disastrous results. For a useful guide see  <strong><a href="Members/sue/R2012-01-31-2">here</a>.</strong></li>
<li>Corruption exists in Thailand and can affect visiting cruising yachts. Read this <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand/thailand-phuket-phang-nga-bay-thai-officials-try-to-fine-australian-yacht">news article</a></strong> for more about what to watch out for.</li>

<div><p>In May 2014 the Thai army took over control of the country. The <span>nationwide curfew was lifted by the military government</span> on June 13th and<span> the security situation has returned to normal. </span><span>Reports claim that the country will be under military rule for around 15 months when national elections will be held.</span></p>
<p><span>Security reports from cruisers in Thailand were in the past very rare. Theft and attacks on  yachts are few and far between, however even here, burglaries, dinghy and outboard theft does  indeed happen. Cruisers are advised to treat their dinghy and outboard as they  would their family car - lock it or lose it and put it in the garage (i.e. on  davits our lifted out of the water) at night.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Cruisers that have fallen victim to crime in Thailand warn of the potential difficulties resulting from robberies: lengthy police interviews (days not hours); interpretation problems; "obviation fees"; immigration visas reissuing; obtaining passports overseas etc. These take up much more time, effort and worry than the original robbery.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2014 Security Reports</strong></span></p>
<p><span>So far this year we have only heard of a burglary at the <span>Koh Hong Group in Phang Nga, where the thieves entered through the main hatch which was closed, but not locked, whilst the owners were ashore. <span>It appears there are increasing numbers of boat robberies being officially and unofficially reported in this area and local marinas are advising all boat owners to lock boats securely and remove anything valuable from the deck when away from their yachts.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>2013 Security Reports</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, for the first time since most can remember, there were two armed attacks on yachts in <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Thailand/thailand-phuket-chalong-shots-fired-as-yacht-robbery-thwarted">Phuket, Chalong Bay in April 2013</a></strong>. One attack involving knives, and another guns.</p>
<p>Cruisers also reported at the end of 2013 that Koh Phi Phi has a bit of reputation for boardings and burglaries.</p>
<p>A new and disturbing action regarding some Thai fishing boats appearing to deliberately trying to ram yachts was also reported in June 2013. See <a href="Countries/Thailand/thailand-worrying-incidents-regarding-the-actions-of-thai-fishing-boats"><strong>this report</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In August 2013 there was a rapid growth of bomb attacks and ambushes by Islamic insurgents in the southern Tailand provinces of Yala,Narathiwat, Songkhla, Hat Yai. Large fires were set both in rural and suburban areas; several people were killed and dozens injured. It is strongly advised to check travel advisories if planning on going close to the Thai- Malayan border.</p>

<div><p>Very humid tropical climate. March to May are the hottest months and it is cooler from November to February. June to October: rainy season &amp; SW monsoon; November to May:  NE monsoon. The latter season has more pleasant weather, plus better sailing conditions along the sheltered west coast, most of whose ports are untenable during the SW monsoon.</p>
