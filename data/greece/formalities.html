<div><p><b>Update January 2016: </b>Due to the current situation with regard to the number of migrants and refugees attempting to enter Europe, a number of Schengen Area countries have re-introduced border controls. Therefore, it is advisable that cruisers now check with the official authorities when entering or leaving a country.<span> </span></p>
<p>While at sea it is also advisable that any sightings of refugee/migrant boats be immediately reported to the appropriate Coast Guard via VHF. This is especially important if it is necessary to rescue any whose life is in danger.</p>
<p>The Greek courtesy flag must be flown and also it should be in good condition, as torn or frayed flags are regarded as a sign of disrespect.</p>
<p>As Greece is a member of the European Union, formalities for EU vessels and nationals should be simple, although this does not always appear to be the case.</p>
<p><strong>Port Police (Hellenic Coast Guard)</strong></p>
<p>The Hellenic Coast Guard, colloquially known as Port Police or PP, should <strong>only</strong> <strong>be visited</strong> when:<br/>(1) entering the country from outside the Schengen Area, <strong>or</strong> <br/>(2) once a year after that to have your DEKPA or transit log (Greek cruising papers) checked for the new Circulation Tax (TPP) payments (see further details below).</p>
<p>On entering the country, the PP will want to see the yacht registration certificate, the Greek language certificate of third party insurance (see<strong> <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities#Documents">Documents</a></strong> below with revised limits), and they will ask for a crew list with passport numbers and birth dates. Very rarely, other certificates (competence or radio) may be asked for (again see documents below). If you have a DEKPA from a previous visit, they will record your entry into the country.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Law 4256 which came into effect on 14 April 2014, <strong>PP permission </strong><strong>is no longer needed;</strong><br/>(a) when arriving in harbour <br/>(b) to haul out <br/>(c) to re-launch <br/>(d) to leave harbour <br/>(e) to change crew lists.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Also, boats arriving from outside the Schengen Area no longer have to use a port of entry, but in practice</span><span> still need to enter at a PP manned port as the appropriate entry forms must be completed. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Authorities in the Eastern Aegean do recommend checking into Greece through an agency. By law, this is optional, but harbour fees must be paid via an agency and therefore in order to ensure a straightforward clearance, it may be simpler to use an agency. </span></p>
<p><strong>N<span>ew Circulation Tax (TPP) </span></strong><br/><span>This is the controversial tax which was due to come into force in January 2014, but there is still no indication if or when TPP collection will start. </span></p>
<p>It is intended that TPP will be payable by all boats over 7m afloat in Greek waters, irrespective of how short a time they actually spend there. The Cruising Association are in direct contact with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and the Aegean who are responsible for implementing this tax. See a full description at <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://cruising.org.uk/news/greektax#TPP">http://cruising.org.uk/news/greektax#TPP</a></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Formalities for EU Boats</strong></p>
<p><span>For EU boats over 10m, a DEKPA must be purchased from the PP (DEKPA are the<span> Greek initials for a "Cruising Bulletin" or "Private Pleasure Boat Maritime Traffic Document")</span>. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>The DEKPA is an official log of entry and exit from ports and <span>remains permanently valid for that boat. <span>While the boat stays in Greece, the DEKPA only has to be presented to PP once a year. </span></span>You have permission to keep the yacht (but not necessarily yourselves) in the country indefinitely. </span></p>
<p><span>EU boats under 10m do not need a DEKPA.</span></p>
<p><strong>Formalities for Non-EU boats with a non-EU skipper</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Formalities for non-EU vessels can be just as complicated as before and so the entire procedure is described below, even if in practice this may not be strictly adhered to by local officials.</p>
<p>On arrival in Greece, clear with Port Police, Immigration, Customs and then back to Port Police (in that order).</p>
<p><span>Customs will issue non-EU boats with a transit document (Transit Log) instead of a DEKPA, valid for six months. Only one transit log can be issued every 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span>The Tranist Log is a permit to cruise in Greece for 6 months. It costs 30 Euros for private owners. </span><span>It is completed in Greek and English with details of the yacht, crew, fuel and other provisions. The log must be produced when requested and must also record any crew changes. It must be surrendered to Customs on leaving Greek waters.</span></p>
<p><span>Whereas previously the Transit Log was extendable for up to 18 months, in January 2015 </span><span>a retrospective law was introduced that </span><span>from the 1st July 2014 the <strong>transit log is no </strong></span><strong><strong>lo</strong></strong><strong>nger extendable</strong><span> up to 18 months unless the boat is in bond (i.e. vacated and in-active in a marina or out of the water).</span></p>
<p><span>See <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities#Documents"><strong>Documents</strong></a> for full details on the rules of the transit log.</span></p>
<p>Denying non-EU boats up to 18 months in Greece is totally against EU rules, but, as ever, Greece has gone its own way and with the recent change of Government there, it is not expected that the situation will change any time soon. Boats have already been fined for breaching this law (see <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> for details of fines).</p>
<p>See<strong> <a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece/greece-non-eu-yachts-beware-if-planning-to-cruise-more-than-6-months-in-greece">noonsite news article</a></strong> which has full details about this important change.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The time permitted by Customs is for the boat, not for the crew (where visa rules apply). It is likely the boat can stay longer in Greece than the crew are permitted under Immigration laws.</p>
<p><strong>Formalities for Non-EU Boats with an EU skipper</strong><br/> Such boats are issued with a transit log <strong>for one month only</strong> after which time they must leave Greece or pay VAT. <span>Tip: If you have a European passport, but you live more than 6 months in a non EU country, then is important to have the right documents to prove this, in order to obtain a transit log for 6 months instead of 1 month.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Notes</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>As of 1 August 2014 Harbour Dues are no longer payable to the PP, but instead are collected by the local authority (</span><i>Limeniko Tameo</i><span>) responsible for managing the quay (often payable via an agency). In some smaller ports, the PP have been designated managers for the quay. See </span><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong><span> for more details.</span></li>
<li><span>Fees charged and regulations enforced are inconsistent throughout Greece, often common in countries that are so wide spread with a multitude of islands and regions. Where reported, noonsite has made a note under ports that are reported to be expensive or difficult.</span></li>
<li><span>The PP have been told of all new procedures and regulations, however you may find that in some ports the PP are still ignoring instructions and clinging to old procedures (visits every 30 days).</span></li>
<li><span>Note that the Greek Coast Guard does not monitor or call on VHF Ch 16. If you require assistance you must call them on Ch 12. Monitor Ch 12 on entering a port in case the port police wish to call you. However, be cautious about calling for assistance via VHF (use a mobile instead, if possible) as it is very likely you will be caught up in the Greek legal system. </span></li>
<li><span>In the case of a distress call or a boat being towed into a harbour, the boat may be detained until it has been declared seaworthy. This could involve an expensive visit from a authorised surveyor.</span></li>
<li><span>Also, the port police must be informed of all injuries suffered on board any vessel in Greek waters. The port police have a legal obligation to pass on all details to the public prosecutor who will decide whether the captain has been negligent. Legal processes in Greece can take years!</span></li>

<div><p>Greece is a member of the Schengen Agreement Area. See <a href="General/EuropeanUnion"><strong>Noonsite' Schengen page</strong> </a> for more details on the immigration rules.</p>
<p>It <b>may</b> be possible to obtain a short-term residence visa (90 days) for non-EU nationals from the nearest police station if you can show a compelling reason you need to stay and have sufficient funds. This allows a total stay of 6 months. This is extension is applicable to Greece only, not elsewhere in the EU.  Staying for <b>tourist purposes</b> is <b>not</b> permitted.</p>
<p>Entry may be refused if there are Turkish Cyprus stamps in the passport.</p>
<p>Individual passports are not usually stamped on entry into Greece by yacht, nor is this done for departure with the same yacht.</p>
<p>However, non-EU nationals should insist that their passports are stamped on both entry and exit.</p>
<p>If any crew member leaves the country other than by yacht, then passport stamps are required by Immigration at the point of exit.</p>
<p>If you overstay your visa, you will be fined (usually double the cost of an extension). Officials are vigilant over applying this, unless you have been immobilized is hospital, for example.</p>
<p><span>For immigration control, boats should carry an up to date crew list with passport or ID numbers, to be shown on request. There is no need to have this authenticated.</span></p>

<div><p>Firearms must be declared and will be sealed in a safe area on board.</p>
<p>Foreign yachts can buy fuel at duty-free prices, which must be arranged through Customs. Stations that sell fuel for foreign yachts are marked by blue and yellow diagonal stripes on the quay.</p>
<p>EU regulations <strong>should apply</strong> concerning temporary importation. However, this is not currently the situation in Greece. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="General/EuropeanUnion">EU VAT</a> </strong>page for more information.</p>
<p>For non-EU boats the Transit Log is supposed to have an inventory attached - quote from the Greek regulation - "Into the Transit Log must be entered, large portable items of a certain value such as electrical appliances, scuba diving gear etc. so that these can be re-exported once more, otherwise these must be cleared. Customs privileges only apply to equipment that is permanently installed on the craft and is necessary for the navigation and safety of the craft, as well as all crew and passengers personal belongings."</p>
<p>If VAT has been paid on a non-EU boat, then a permanent Transit Log should be issued.</p>
<p>Products of animal origin, not originating from an EU member state, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Norway, San Marino or Switzerland, are not permitted to be imported into an EU Member state.</p>
<p><span>Codeine is an illegal substance in Greece. A prescription issued in another country may not allow its importation.</span></p>

<div><p>No special medications or immunizations are necessary for travel to Greece, but do not drink tap water unless it has been boiled, filtered, or chemically disinfected.</p>
<p>Greece has a national health care system which is inexpensive and readily available. There are three kinds of medical facilities: The large cities have the largest and best equipped hospitals, while smaller city hospitals are adequate for emergency situations. Smaller towns and villages have medical centres adequate for advice and first aid in case of emergencies. If you do not have insurance, you can get examined at any hospital for about $2, and get first aid attention.</p>
<p>Pharmacies in Greece are also able to provide first aid for simple matters, and can give competent advice. They are identified by the "Green Cross" emblem and are open during normal business hours (8:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM to 8:30 PM). Most staff speak English, and the medicines are normal European quality.</p>
<p>Useful emergency telephone numbers:-<br>
24hr pharmacies                107<br>
Hospitals                      106<br>

<p>Greek Authorities are rigorously applying entry regulations due to Avian Flu.
Incoming yachts should call Port Authority on VHC Ch12 advising ETA. Fly
the "Q" flag and do not go ashore until Port Authorities have been aboard.</p>
<p>Infestation by rats can be a problem in some harbours and appropriate precautions should be taken on the mooring and anchoring warps.</p>

<div><p>Yachts must carry their original registration document and ship's radio licence. One member of the crew must have a radio operator’s certificate of competence.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance Certificate</strong></p>
<p>The original insurance certificate must be carried and a Greek translation showing third party insurance with the amounts in figures.</p>
<p>The minimum amounts (revised April 2014) are 500,000 euro liability for death or injury by sinking, collision or other cause for crew and third parties; 150,000 euro for damage and 150,000 euro for pollution.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if a boat is owned by a company or corporation, it will cause fewer difficulties with the authorities if the name of the company is the same as that of the boat (or nearly so).</p>
<p><strong>ICC</strong></p>
<p>The skipper must have an International Certificate of Competence (ICC). Cruisers have reported that <span>Greek authorities (especially in the south) were asking for the ICC. </span></p>
<p><strong>EU Boats - VAT</strong></p>
<p>For EU boats, proof of VAT status is also required. See <a href="General/EuropeanUnion/VAT"><strong>EU  VAT</strong></a> for the rules on Temporary Importation (TI) for non-EU boats.</p>
<p><strong>EU Boats - DEKPA</strong><br/><span>All EU boats over 10m must purchase a Traffic Document (DEKPA). <span>The DEKPA is an official log of entry and exit from ports and </span><span>remains permanently valid for that boat. While the boat stays in Greece, the DEKPA only has to be presented to PP once a year.</span></span></p>
<p>It is not uncommon for no DEKPA forms to be available. In this case, get your crew list stamped and the lack of DEKPA forms noted upon it.</p>
<p><strong>Non-EU Registered Boats - Transit Log</strong></p>
<p><span>A Transit Document (Log) is issued at the first port of clearance and is valid for six months. This is no longer extendable for up to 18 months unless the boat is put in bond (either bonded in a marina or out of the water in a boatyard, vacated and in-active<span>)</span>. </span></p>
<p>For example, cruise in Greece May to October. In October, lay the boat up for the winter in either a marina, or a boatyard, and hand the Transit Log to the Customs officer as soon as the boat is vacated. This effectively will "stop the clock". You can then return to continue cruising in Greece 6 months later. In May when you return make an application for extending the transit log for another 6 months and pay the transit log fee once again.</p>
<p>It also pays to tell the port police if you haul out, and when you re-enter (as proof that the boats was out of commission and not being used).</p>
<p>See <strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Greece?rc=Formalities#Fees">Fees</a></strong> for details of Transit Log fees and fines for overstaying.</p>
<p><span>Note that officially, crew and passengers on board a yacht are considered by the authorities to be in transit, and the transit log only authorises day visits inland, the nights being presumed to be spent on board. Immigration should be notified if travelling away from the yacht overnight or if an individual leaves Greece by other means such as by air. These changes have to be noted in the transit log and entry and exit stamps put into the passport.</span></p>
<p>Note: Channel Island yachts are classed as non-EU. See report <a href="Members/sue/R2011-06-04-2"><strong>here</strong></a> for more details.</p>
<p>See <a href="Countries/Greece/?rc=Formalities#Fees"><strong>Fees</strong></a> for the charges for the various documents.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Not all all officals in all Greek ports (expecially the smaller, more remote ones) are fully aware of the correct documents required, but failure to have the proper documents can involve heavy fines at a later stage.</p>
