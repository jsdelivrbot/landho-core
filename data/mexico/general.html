<p><!-- 
28/03/2012 VE updated clearance, customs, links.  
07/04/2012 SR reworded clearance opener and added a para about inconsistencies in regs. in Mexico (ie. between 2 sides). Seems that Pacific side a Zarpe has never been asked for - so problems are only on Caribbean side.   
10/05/2012 SR reworded immigration as this odd 24 miles off needing a visa rule seems not to be enforced. Info. from RSchooling re arriving in Islas Mujeres. Same time also restyled clearance and documents. Documents want to clarify the TIP, if it's mandatory or not. Have asked RS for clarification.   
17/05/2012 SR had good info. from RS re TIP from his agent, so have updated bits of text about it in clearance and section in documents.   
16/07/2012 SR Basically the zarpe rule is Caribbean side only. Pacific side is v. cruiser friendly. Also, offshore visa is for fisherman who never visit port. So have amended clearance and immigration accordingly.   
11/10/2012 SR Picked up from Latitude 38 new immigration rules, although there does not seem to be very many details and how they are going to implement them is dubious. Report posted and have linked to report from noonsite text. 
24/11/2012 VE correction of fishing licence cost (pesos NOT US$) from Cathie Kerr (schoonerwindjammer@hotmail.com)  
17/01/2013 SR Interesting that the TIP can only be got online by those who have a US or CAN address. all others have to find a port that can issue it on entry. Have updated notes. Dan consulted a number of cruisers in La Paz and gave us a list of ports on w coast that are simple for tip applic.  
07/06/2013 SR Turns out Cancun is the place on E coast to get a TIP.  
12/08/2013 SR Added note to TIP in documents about boats owned by companies needing notarised docs. 
03/06/2015 CP checked Publicatiions
