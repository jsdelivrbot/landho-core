<div><p><strong>Note on International Date Line: </strong><span>Since 2011, Samoa has been on the New Zealand side of the International Date Line. If you arrive from the Cook Islands or French Polynesia you will skip a day. None of the cruising guides mention this, but as the Samoan authorities do not clear boats at the weekend, it is worth planning for. American Samoa, however, is still on the French Polynesian side of the Date Line.</span></p>
<p>Noonsite has now been advised that <strong>it is necessary</strong> to give 48 hours prior notice of arrival. This can be done by emailing <a href="mailto://portmaster@spasamoa.ws">portmaster@spasamoa.ws</a> or <a href="mailto:spa@spasamoa.ws">spa@spasamoa.ws</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a class="external-link" href="Countries/Samoa/Apia">Apia</a> </strong>is the only official port of entry on Samoa.</p>
<p>Call the Apia harbour master on VHF Ch. 16 when 1 or 2 hours away and they will give permission to enter the harbour. You may need to try several times.</p>
<p>Do not go alongside the main wharf, or drop anchor, until permission and directions are given by harbour control. <span>If arriving at the weekend, clearance will take place on Monday, but Port control will advise on protocols. It is also not possible to clear in the evenings.</span></p>
<p>Officially you must contact each clearance department (Customs, Immigraton and Quarantine) separately via the Samoan Government website which can be found here: <strong><a href="http://www.samoagovt.ws/">http://www.samoagovt.ws/</a>.</strong></p>
<p>However, in reality, you may find after contacting Port Control, they will contact all the authorities on your behalf and arrange for them to come to your boat for clearance. Be patient, as you may find that they all arrive seperately.</p>
<p><i><strong>Notice September 2013:</strong> Cruisers report that d<span>rug searches are being stepped up in Apia. If you arrive in Apia with clearance from a Central or Southern Americas port, Officials will search your boat. Also, if Apia is not the named destination on your clearance they will search you. The searches can last all day and involve more than ten persons and two drug dogs.</span></i></p>
<p>See  <a href="Countries/Samoa/?rc=Formalities#Restrictions"><strong>Restrictions</strong></a> for controls on anchoring.</p>
<p>If you want to leave the boat at the marina while you fly home, give yourself enough time, as you need to apply in writing for permission and wait until it has been granted.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantine</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">International yachts entering Samoa waters are considered to be of a high biosecurity risk and are closely monitored by Quarantine. It is important to be aware of the clearance procedures for yachts.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; ">The skipper must complete a Master’s Declaration Form declaring all biosecurity risk items on board that are either restricted or prohibited.</span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; "><strong><i>Items to declare include: </i></strong></span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; ">Foods (tinned/packed), including meat, sausages, salami, ham, poultry, eggs, milk, butter, cheese, honey etc;</span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; ">Plants or parts of plants (live or dead) including vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, bulbs, flowers (fresh or dry), mushrooms, straw, bamboo or any other articles made of plant materials;</span><br style="text-align: justify; "/><span style="text-align: justify; ">Animal products including feathers, fur/skin, shells, hatching eggs.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span style="text-align: justify; ">All refuse generated on the vessel must be placed in a suitable leak-proof container, with a lid, and the container is securely fastened at all times and kept aboard the yacht. The refuse can only be removed from the yachts under the directions of the Quarantine Officer and costs<span> $4 Samoan dollars (Tala) per bag to drop off at the Quarantine office</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify; "><span style="text-align: justify; "><strong>Clearing Out</strong></span></span></p>
<p>This requires a visit to the Immigration Office which is in town (taxi ride $5 tala). Take your passports. This office is very crowded. Do not take a number, instead ask at the desk "where do ship captains get clearance?". You will be shown into a back room to complete the paperwork.</p>
<p>Then go to the Customs Office to obtain clearance.  A clearance fee is payable at the Customs Office, so it's important to arrive no later than 2pm as the cash office closes at 4pm.</p>
<p>Once cleared you have a few hours to depart.</p>
