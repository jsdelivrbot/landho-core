      Milne Bay Province includes the Louisiade Archipelago, D'Entrecasteaux Islands, Woodlark, and many more far flung islands.  Every year during the first week of November, villagers from these remote islands sail their ocean going sailing canoes, loaded down with yams, pigs, and even old ladies and babies, to Alotau for the National Canoe and Kundu Festival.  Though a great event for spectators, the festival is a really big deal for the locals and they use it as a modern way of carrying out some of their traditional customs.  This is the land where sailing canoes are used in the legendary Kula Ring Trading Circle. Read more at the cruisers report linked to above.
