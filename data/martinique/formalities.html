<div><p>Fly the French courtesy flag (not the Martinique one).</p>
<p>Boats must complete Customs and Immigration formalities at one of the official ports of entry as soon after arrival as possible.</p>
<p>All offices use a computer terminal now, just fill in the blanks, print, get it stamped and you're done.</p>
<p><i>Note that not all the offices have reliable computers for clearance. St. Pierre in particular is often out of order. </i></p>
<p>The original ship's registration papers must be available as copies are not accepted.</p>
<p>For boats arriving from across the Atlantic, Cul-de-Sac Marin is perhaps a more convenient port to clear in. There is now a large charter base there.</p>
<p><strong>Outward clearance:</strong> It is essential to clear out at one of the official ports so as to obtain the clearance certificate which is requested when clearing in at all other islands. Therefore one must try to clear out during office hours.</p>

<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months beyond the length of your stay.</p>
<p>As an Overseas department of France, visa requirements are as as for the French mainland. Most visitors do not need visas for stays of up to 3 months. Although regarded as part of the EU, it is <strong>not</strong> a member of the Schengen Agreement Area.</p>
<p>Visas are required for citizens of <span>South Africa, Bolivia, Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Turkey, Dominica, St Lucia, Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.</span></p>
<p>Any non-EU citizen planning a stay over three months will need a visa. In theory EU citizens would also need a visa, but this is not applied to those arriving and leaving on the same yacht.</p>
<p>Non-EU nationals should have a visa if planning to fly in or out of Martinique.</p>

The fruit, resembling small apples, the leaves, the bark, the sap, EVERYTHING is toxic. Do not shelter under this tree if it rains and do not use its branches in a barbecue.
