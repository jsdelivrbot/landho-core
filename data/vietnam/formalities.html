<div><p>Permission to visit any port must be obtained in advance from a Vietnamese diplomatic mission abroad. This can be done at the same time as when applying for the visa, but as permission must be given by several government departments, the procedure takes time and can be very expensive.</p>
<p>It is advisable to use an agent to arrange the clearance procedures.</p>
<p>When in radio range, call the Port Control and they will issue directions. It is likely you will be required to take a pilot on board.</p>
<p>If leaving the boat overnight to travel inland, it is necessary to have a guard posted.</p>
