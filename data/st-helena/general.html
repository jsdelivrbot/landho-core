<div><p>St Helenian pound (£) of 100 pence, fixed at parity with £ sterling. Sterling currency can be used everywhere; change is given in St. Helena Pounds.</p>
<p><span>Before leaving all money should be changed back to sterling, as the notes are not valid outside of St. Helena and Ascension Island.</span></p>
<p>There is one bank in Jamestown. See <strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.Noonsite.com/Countries/StHelena/Jamestown?rc=ShoreServices#Banks">Banks</a></strong> for further info. It's easy to get caught out here as there are no ATMs. <span>The bank can do cash advances on Visa or Mastercard but there is a service charge.</span></p>
<p><span>A few shops and businesses do accept credit cards. </span><span>The Yacht Club and the Consulate Hotel accept credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span>Cruisers however recommend that the easiest solution is to arrive in St Helena with <span>Pound Sterling from South Africa. </span></span></p></div>

<div><p>The U.K. government decided in 2010 that the long term economic independence of the island would be best served by the building of an airport. This is due to open in February 2016. It has already received a test flight (Sept 2015).</p>
<p>Sadly, once the airport is open, the mail ship. one of which has served the island since 1502, will be retired.</p>
<p><span>There is a limited local bus service, timetable from the tourist office on main street.</span></p>
<p>Cars can be rented via the tourist office.</p>
<p>The main taxi stand is behind the tourist office and another by the main jetty. Taxis are un-metred so agree a price before taking a ride.</p>
<p>There is a water taxi/ferry service in the mooring field/anchorage. See Jamestown for further info.</p></div>
